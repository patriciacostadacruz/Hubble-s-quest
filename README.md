## Description

After years of fighting crime, this time you'll find Jerry in our lovely Barcelona. He only has one goal: ban robberies and allow Barcelona to find its tranquility once again.
Jerry once was this mellow and calm husband we all knew in Rick & Morty, but after his divorce with Bet, Jerry found his true vocation: saving the world.
He has been traveling around the globe and didn't leave a city until crime was completely eradicated.
With Jerry in Barcelona, carteritas won't last long.
